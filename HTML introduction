# HTML Introduction

## What is HTML ?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. The front end of a web page is written using HTML and CSS gives style to it. The smallest working piece of an HTML page can be called as element. Most of the elements has an open tag and a closing tag. 
Opening tag looks like : `< tag-name >` and a closing tag looks like : `</ tag-name >`. The only difference between opening and closing tag is the `/` (forward slash).
