## What is a website ?
A website can be defined as a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages. These web pages are stored in a server. If some one wants to access these web pages, They can do so by using any web browser (A software to access websites. For example google chrome, Mozila firefox, Internet explorer etc). On any web browser type the [IP address](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-an-ip-address) or the [domain name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name) of the [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server) to access the main page or [home page](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/homepage.htm) of the website. Then you can visit to other pages using links available on the home page. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes.

## How many types of web developers are there ?
There are three types of web developers.
1. Front End Developers : These are also called web designers. When you open any website you see it in a web browser. This visible part is called front end. It may have images, menu bar, different sections, texts in many colors etc. Front end developers use HTML and CSS to design it and JavaScript to make it [interactive](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for). 

The front end is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.

The back end refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.

Full-stack developers are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. In The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development.
