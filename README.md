## What is a website ?
A website can be defined as a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages. These web pages are stored in a server. If some one wants to access these web pages, They can do so by using any web browser (A software to access websites. For example google chrome, Mozila firefox, Internet explorer etc). On any web browser type the [IP address](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-an-ip-address) or the [domain name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name) of the [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server) to access the main page or [home page](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/homepage.htm) of the website. Then you can visit to other pages using links available on the home page. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes.

## How many types of web developers are there ?
There are three types of web developers.
1. Front End Developers : These are also called web designers. When you open any website you see it in a web browser. This visible part is called front end. It may have images, menu bar, different sections, texts in many colors etc. Front end developers use HTML and CSS to design it and JavaScript to make it [interactive](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for). 

2. Back End Developers : The back end refers to the server side programming of the application. All the images data and records that you are seeing on the browser were received from server. But there is a limitation in that. Take an example of a bank site, you can send money to some one else but you can not increase your balance. Take an example of a social network web site, you can see the photos your friend uploaded but you can't delete it. These type of restrictions are written by the programmer. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.

3. Full-stack developers : These developers can work on both the front and back end. In large companies number of front developers work on front end task and number of back end developers work on back end task. But in [startups](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-a-startup/) 5 to 10 full stack developers work on a project. So if you are a full stack developer, you can apply in large companies as well as startups.
