# First project
This is the first project where we will learn implementation of some of the commands those we have learnt till now. This project won't look very pretty. But don't worry for that because it is our first project and we have not learnt all those commands required to make a website look pretty and professional.

## Project Steps
- Create a folder of your own name on `C` or `D` drive.
- Create an `index.html` file with in that folder. Make sure to name it `index.html`, because this name plays an important role. When we open any website, `index.html` is the first file that opens as home page.
- create three more files as `receipe1.html`, `receipe2.html` and `receipe3.html`
- Contents of `index.html`
  - Create a page heading with proper tag
  - Create a list of three items that refer to the three other pages created
- Contents of receipe pages
  - Create a page heading with receipe name
  - Show receipe image in the page
  - Write a description heading followed by a short description
  - below the description write an unordered list of ingredients
  - below that write an ordered list of steps required to make the dish

## Final Output
Open the website in any web browser to know how it looks.

Note : You can use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or any other online tool or offline tool to resize all the images as per your choice, So the website will look good.
